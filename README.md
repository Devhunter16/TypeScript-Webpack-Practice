What is Webpack?

Web apps today have more JavaScript than ever before. They may consist of files on files on files of JavaScript. Each script requires a new HTTP request, which can slow down apps and lead to bottlenecks if the app requires a lot of them! So what if we just put all the JS code into one file? Well that would be a nightmare to read! So what Webpack does is it allows us to bundle our assets (like a hundred javascript files with tons of libraries) to boil them down into some sort of bundled file or files that we can then load as a single script!
